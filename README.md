# FinalProject-Object_Detector-Analyzer

The primary challenge in object detection is the variation and amount of the objects,
their positions and distortions at acting making it difficult to create a generic model
that can detect all objects accurately. This project aimed to overcome this problem by
using a large, collected diverse dataset and deep learning techniques. In modern days,
we can face with it almost everywhere, for example, traffic cameras, face id on our
gadgets, qr scanners and list goes on. But what if we collect every data that appears
and classificate them, which allows us to analyze every single moment, and then to
take a corresponded actions.
