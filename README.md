# FinalProject-Object_Detector-Analyzer

The primary challenge in object detection is the variation and amount of the objects,
their positions and distortions at acting making it difficult to create a generic model
that can detect all objects accurately. This project aimed to overcome this problem by
using a large, collected diverse dataset and deep learning techniques. In modern days,
we can face with it almost everywhere, for example, traffic cameras, face id on our
gadgets, qr scanners and list goes on. But what if we collect every data that appears
and classificate them, which allows us to analyze every single moment, and then to
take a corresponded actions.

There have been several solutions proposed for object detection in real time. Some of
the popular techniques include using color-based segmentation, feature-based
methods, and deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). In this project, we focused on using
deep learning techniques, which have shown promising results in recent years. Some
of the notable works in this field include "Recent advances in deep learning for object
detection" by Xiongwei Wu , and "Deep learning in multi-object detection and
tracking: state of the art" by Sankar K. Pal and Anima Paramanik.
